# de_int
This is the numerical integration program using double exponential transformation. 
This code can calculate the integral from a to b and the integral from a to infinity shown by the following formulae.
It also supports the integration of complex functions.
I made it to integrate a complex function which has a singular point.

$$ I = \int_a^b f(x) \\, dx $$
$$ I = \int_a^\infty f(x) \\, dx $$
$f(x)$ needs to be analytic within the integral region. Â 


## Usage of the example code
 1. type 'make' command to compile.
 2. type './example.out' to run.
 
Please see de_int.h for detail of functions, example.c for detail of function usages.


## Regarding the examples
- Example 1  
  $$ I = \int_a^b \frac{1}{\cos^2 x} \\,dx = \tan b - \tan a $$
  
- Example 2  
  $$ I = \int_a^b \exp(ix) \\,dx = -i(\exp(ib)-\exp(ia)) $$
  
- Example 3  
  $$ I(s) = \int_0^{\infty} \exp(-sx) \\,dx = \frac{1}{s}, \\ \\ \\ s > 0 $$
  
- Example 4  
  $$ I(s) = \int_0^{\infty} x \\, \exp(-sx) \\,dx = \frac{1}{s^2}, \\ \\ \\ \Re s > 0 $$

Examples 3 and 4 are known as Laplace transform related to the Heaviside step function.


## Tips for improper integral  
  In the case of the upper or lower limit of the integration is a singular point, change the variables so that 0 is the singular point.
  This is to avoid a	loss of significant digits near the singular point. 
  When a is a singular point
  $$ I = \int_a^b f(x) \\, dx = \int_0^{b-a} f(t+a) \\, dt, \\ \\ \\ x=t+a.$$
